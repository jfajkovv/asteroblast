# Dependencies
This project was created via SuperWires PyGame submodule. You'll need some stuff in order to play. *pip* is highly recommended for installing packages.

`pip install pygame superwires`

Then simply use `python asteroblast.py` from the repo folder in order to have some fun.

# Credits and thanks
All graphical assets were prepared by my beloved GF. Thank you, sweetheart.

Sounds were obtained from handy [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) community.

This game wouldn't be half as good without these assets.

# Notes
The game is playable but still under development.
